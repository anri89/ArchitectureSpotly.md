# Spotly  
## Technical Architecture (Final Submission)

---

## 1. Purpose, Function & Audience

Spotly is a mood-based city discovery app.  
Users explore nearby places and events based on “vibes” (chill, artsy, lively, cozy, etc.) instead of traditional categories.

The app lets users:

- Browse a map of recommended spots  
- Add their own spots with photos, descriptions and tags  
- Find similar people through shared vibes (friends/matching feature)

**Audience:**  
Students, young adults, creatives and anyone who enjoys exploring cities, discovering hidden gems, and sharing local recommendations.

## 2. Technology Stack & Application Architecture

### **Frontend**
- HTML + CSS (custom gradient styling, modern UI components)
- EJS templates for rendering dynamic views
- Vanilla JavaScript for basic UI interactions (forms, toggles)

### **Backend**
- Node.js  
- Express.js for routing and controller structure  
- EJS as templating engine  
- express-session for handling login state  

### **Database**
- MongoDB  
- Mongoose for data models and validation  

### **Data Models (Planned + In Progress)**

**User**
- username  
- email  
- passwordHash  
- preferred vibes (used for matching feature)

**Spot**
- title  
- description  
- locationName  
- vibe tags  
- createdBy (ref User)  
- image placeholder (real uploads coming later)

### **Architecture Summary**
- User → Browser → Express routes  
- Route handlers fetch data via Mongoose  
- Server renders EJS templates with dynamic content  
- Some pages (e.g., Explore) integrate a future map API for coordinates  
- Static assets (CSS, gradient backgrounds) served via `/public`

## 3. UI/UX Design Considerations

Spotly focuses heavily on aesthetic mood and simplicity.

### **Visual identity**
- Gradient colour palettes representing “vibes” and energy  
- Smooth rounded cards for spots and people  
- Clean typography and consistent spacing  

### **Navigation**
- Top navigation bar (Explore, Add Spot, Friends, Profile)  
- Clear CTA buttons such as **Explore the map** and **Find Matches**

### **User flow**
- Landing page introduces the app + vibe categories  
- Explore page includes:  
  - Search bar  
  - Map container  
  - Spot list on the right  
- Add Spot page includes a clean form with vibe tag selection  
- Friends page shows suggested matches based on shared vibes  

### **Responsiveness**
- Mobile-first layout  
- Cards stack or adjust width for smaller screens

## 4. Major Features (MVP & Future)

### **MVP**
- Explore page with example spot cards  
- Add Spot form  
- Basic MongoDB storage for spots  
- Static friend suggestions  
- Basic login/logout (in progress)  
- Clean responsive UI  

### **Future / Stretch Features**
- Leaflet map integration  
- Geocoding API for converting location text → coordinates  
- Image uploads (Multer)  
- Friends/matching algorithm  
- Personalised explore feed  
- Bookmarks / favourites

## 5. Anticipated Challenges

- Map integration and rendering markers  
- Handling photo uploads and storage  
- Designing vibe-matching logic  
- Ensuring fast loading with map + lists combined  
- Client + server validation  
- Maintaining clean route/controller structure  

---

## 6. Experiments Undertaken

- Tested Leaflet in EJS layout  
- Experimented with gradient styling  
- Vibe-tag system design  
- Tried different Express route structures  
- Mocking friend-matching logic  
- Researching geocoding API providers

## 7. Learning Points

- Structuring Node + Express + MongoDB apps  
- Using EJS templates and partials  
- Understanding how UI design affects usability  
- RESTful routing patterns  
- Feature planning (MVP → stretch)  
- GitHub repo organisation and documentation
